# Community-Detection-and-Membership-Prediction
Community Detection and Membership Prediction in Social Network

Dataset Description: For this project, the dataset used is the Facebook Social Network Dataset sourced from the Stanford Network Analysis Project (SNAP). This dataset provides a comprehensive view of user interactions within the Facebook social network, making it a valuable resource for studying community detection and social network analysis.

2 Dataset Name: Facebook Social Network Dataset

3 Data Type: Social Network Graph

4 Total Nodes: 4,039

5 Total Edges: 88,234

6 Number of Features: Variable, depending on the additional attributes available (e.g., node attributes, user profiles).

The project aims to predict the likelihood of a user joining various communities(i.e, facebook groups: Pet Club and Karate Club)
This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model using PyTorch Geometric, a library tailored for deep learning on graphs. This GNN model employs Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layers and is designed for node or graph classification tasks. Below is a breakdown of its architecture and functionality.
